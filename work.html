					<p>Wunder is an educational webapp that focuses on practice based learning.</p>
					<p>This was a joint undertaking between 2 of Wunder Labs very own designers. Due to its interactive nature, we decided to build the backend with <a href="" class="link">Node.js</a> and the <a href="" class="link">Express</a> module to aid development.  This enabled us to share Javascript code between the frontend and backend, and scale the website when we experienced traffic fluctuation.</p>

					<p>Freight30 is a mobile dispatching system designed for trucking companies and 3rd party logistic providers. Dispatchers use a backend portal to send shipment information to their truck drivers via a mobile app. Drivers can then update shipment status and delivery confirmation from the app. Dispatchers are able to view real time information on the status of their shipments through the web-based portal.</p>

					<h3>iPad Point of Sale</h3>
					<span class="handwrittenNote">Business made easy</span>
					<p>A project required us to build a custom iPad interface on top of the enterprise point of sale system, Micros. Our system synced with the locally hosted version of Micros and sent data back and forth to a cloud based server. Multiple iPads could then request the modified data from the cloud server. Integrating with Micros allowed customers to use their existing commerce data, while utilizing the efficiency and mobility of modern mobile technologies.</p>
