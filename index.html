				<h2>Philosophy</h2>
				<!-- <p>We are a design and development studio with a passion for creating stunning web applications. We love making beautiful websites, vibrant designs, and eye-catching mobile apps while giving you the functionality you are looking for.  Whether you need a simple website, or a complex web application, together we will imagine, design, and create the website that fits your needs and personality. Our jobs may not be easy but we wouldn't trade them for anything.</p> -->

				<!-- <p>At Wunder Labs, we love creating products that are both simple and powerful. As a design and development studio, we take your project from start to finish, including you at every step of the way. Starting from scratch also allows us to write clean, maintainable code and create intuitive designs. Your project becomes our inspiration, making sure the result is something you will be proud to call your own.</p> -->
				
				<p>At Wunder Labs, we love creating products that are both simple and powerful. As a design and development studio, we include you at every step of the way to make sure the result is exactly what you want. We approach each project differently with the goal to create something unique and exceptional.  As such, we write clean, maintainable code from scratch and handcraft each design because we've only ever known how to create things with passion and inspiration - not massive frameworks and one-size-fits-all solutions. We guarantee the final product will be something you'll be proud to call your own.</p>

				<h2>Our Process</h2>
				<h4>It's better than magic</h4>
			</div><div class="processesContainer">
					<div class="processContainer half">
						<span class="processTitle">Requirements</span>
						
						<div class="roundButton" id="uiDesignButton">
							<span class="innerRoundButton">
								<span class="icon-file-text"></span>
							</span>
						</div>
						
						<p>We start by discussing the project size, vision, details, and requirements with you.  Once we have a clear idea of your goals, we rapidly iterate through preliminary sketches including your opinions and preferences along the way.  Then we layout milestones that will be completed each week and give you a projection of the length of development, holding us accountable and allowing you to stay up to date on the project's progress.</p>
					</div><div class="processContainer half">
						<span class="processTitle">Design</span>
						
						<div class="roundButton designIcon">
							<span class="innerRoundButton">
								<span class="icon-heart"></span>
							</span>
						</div>
						
						<p>As soon as we understand your vision, we set out to create a simple and elegant design.  This includes wireframes and full blown visual mockups so you know exactly what you're going to get.  We discuss our design decisions and insights about user experience with you so you can understand our choices.  Once you are happy with the initial design, we move onto the full implementation.</p>
					</div><div class="processContainer half">
						<span class="processTitle">Code</span>
						
						<div class="roundButton">
							<span class="innerRoundButton">
								<span class="icon-code"></span>
							</span>
						</div>
						
						<p>When we write code, we make sure that we are using the most appropriate technology to make your project fast, responsive, and secure against sophisticaed attacks. Using HTML5 and CSS3 as our core web tools, our code performs exceptionally well on all screen sizes: phones, tablets, and computers. Our backends are written in many languages including node.js, PHP, Python, and Java.</p>
					</div><div class="processContainer half">
						<span class="processTitle">Review</span>
						
						<div class="roundButton">
							<span class="innerRoundButton">
								<span class="icon-eye-open"></span>
							</span>
						</div>
						
						<p>Every week during the development, we update you with what has been completed.  You can review, comment, and ask about any new features or implementations to let us know what you love and what to improve.  After everything has been completed, we will pass off all assets to you.  Everything we have created is owned by you to reuse, modify, or sell.  </p>
